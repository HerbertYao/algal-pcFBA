Involved in the activation by light of carbon metabolism enzymes, including calvin cycle enzymes. Probably regulated by glutathionylation [PMID: 16263928]. Thioredoxins are small ubiquitous oxidoreductases of ca. 12 kDa found in all free living organisms. These proteins are involved in thiol-disulfide exchange reactions by way of their conserved active site W-C-G(P)-P-C. They reduce disulfide bridges of various target proteins and are involved in a large variety of functions. Non-photosynthetic eukaryotes contain a limited number of TRX with usually one or two isoforms in the cytosol and one in mitochondria, reduced by an NADPH dependent TRX reductase (NTR) present in these compartments. These thioredoxins have been implicated in defense mechanisms against oxidative stress by reducing methionine sulfoxides via methionine sulfoxide reductase (MSR) and by participating in ROS detoxification via peroxiredoxins (PRX). In photosynthetic organisms, several types of TRX have been identified. TRX h are localized in the cytosol or the mitochondria while TRX o are found in mitochondria. These TRX are reduced by NTR as in the case of non photosynthetic organisms. In addition, 4 types of TRX are present in the chloroplast: TRX f, TRX m, TRX x and TRX y. TRX f and TRX m are involved in the regulation by light of key carbon fixation enzymes, such as Calvin cycle enzymes, which are mostly inactive or weakly active in the dark and activated by TRX under illumination. Indeed, these chloroplastic TRX are reduced in the light by photoreduced ferredoxin and ferredoxin thioredoxin reductase (FTR). TRX x and TRX y, identified more recently, seem to be involved in defense mechanisms against oxidative stress since they are efficient substrates for chloroplastic 2-cys PRX and PRX Q.",730,771,-0.0788343961476548,0.150929462624164
