;;;      ---  Parse Results for Chlamydomonas reinhardtii  ---
;;;
;;; This report summarizes the findings of the PathoLogic parser for
;;; the annotation files for all new genetic elements.  Through
;;; inspection of this report, the user can tell whether features of major 
;;; importance were not recognized, possibly due to syntax errors or other
;;; problems in the annotation files.
;;;
;;; If you want to change annotation file(s) to improve their parsability, 
;;; update the files, reinitialize the KB, and re-run the Build.  If you want
;;; to avoid having to reinitialize in the future, use the Trial Parse 
;;; command until you are satisfied with the parse results, and only then
;;; Build.
