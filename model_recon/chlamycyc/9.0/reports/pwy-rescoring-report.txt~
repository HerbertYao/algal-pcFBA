::: Pathway Rescoring Report written at  08-Jun-2018  09:50:54

There are 390 pathways currently in the PGDB.  Of these, 297 pathways were 
previously inferred and their status has not changed.  The remainder are either
newly inferred or require(d) manual confirmation for the various reasons stated
below.  Pathways in the lists below that are marked with an X have been 
interactively deleted.  All other pathways in the various lists below were 
present in the PGDB at report generation time.  
This report was generated on 08-Jun-2018  09:50:54.

2 Pathways that were previously deleted manually now have evidence for additional or different reactions.
 	PWY-6845	nitric oxide biosynthesis I (plants)

0 Pathways that were added since PathoLogic was last run but which now would be pruned.
You should consider deleting most or all of these.


0 Pathways are not present in MetaCyc.  If any of these pathways have been created specifically for your
organism and have experimental evidence and comments, please consider submitting them for inclusion into
MetaCyc.  If not, these are probably pathways that have been deleted from Metacyc (and possibly replaced
with others).  You should consider carefully whether these pathways should be kept or deleted.


7 Pathways have been newly inferred in this organism.
You should check the list for false positives, but otherwise you will want to keep most of these.
