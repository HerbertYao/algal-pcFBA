COMMENT - tRNA(glyU) is one of six glycine tRNAs.
/
/tRNAs are the adapters that allow synthesis of proteins from mRNAs.
/Each tRNA carries a specific amino acid to the ribosome for protein synthesis.
/There, the tRNA recognizes an RNA codon with its own three-nucleotide
/anticodon, thus allowing synthesis of a specific peptide based on an mRNA
/template.
/
/tRNAs are processed to their active, mature forms by RNA cleavage
/and by modification of their bases. RNA cleavage consists of
/removal of both 5' and 3' extensions in a multistep process involving
/many RNases |CITS: [11252717]|. RNases taking part in tRNA processing include |FRAME: CPLX0-3461|,
/|FRAME: CPLX0-3601|, |FRAME: EG10858-MONOMER|,
/|FRAME: EG11620-MONOMER|, and |FRAME: CPLX0-3602|. tRNAs are also subject to a
/wide variety of base modifications catalyzed by proteins such as
/|FRAME: EG11932-MONOMER|, |FRAME: EG10595-MONOMER|, |FRAME: G6364-MONOMER|, |FRAME: EG11344-MONOMER|,
/|FRAME: G7199-MONOMER|, |FRAME: CPLX0-1101|, |FRAME: EG11779-MONOMER|, |FRAME: G7422-MONOMER|,
/|FRAME: G7449-MONOMER|, |FRAME: EG11177-MONOMER|, |FRAME: EG10454-MONOMER|, |FRAME: EG10967-MONOMER|,
/and |FRAME: EG11022-MONOMER|.
/
/Mature tRNAs are linked via a 3' CCA sequence to their cognate
/amino acid in an ATP-dependent fashion by the appropriate
/amino-acid-tRNA synthetase, as shown in the |FRAME: TRNA-CHARGING-PWY|.
/Subsequently, these charged tRNAs interact with the ribosome
/and template mRNA to generate polypeptides. The discovery of the
/role of tRNA in protein synthesis is reviewed in detail in |CITS: [7033244]|.

/A mutation in the anticodon of tRNA(glyV) that results in misinsertion
/of glycine at some aspartate codons, known as <i>mutA</i>, yields
/a substantial increase in AT to TA tranversions, as well as GC to AT and
/AT to GC transversions |CITS: [8633075][2251267][15063131]|. 
/This mutator effect depends on RecA and RecB
/and is a consequence of error-prone replication, possibly due to
/a mutated |FRAME: CPLX0-3803| |CITS: [10320582][10447883]|.
